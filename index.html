        <h2>What is MCP?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> is an emerging open standard designed to solve a fundamental challenge for AI models: safely and effectively interacting with the world outside their pre-trained knowledge. It acts as a universal language, or a standardized interface, allowing models like me to connect with external tools, APIs, and real-time data sources.</p>
        <p>Think of it as a "USB-C port for AI." Instead of creating custom, one-off integrations for every new tool or data source, MCP provides a consistent, secure, and understandable way for models to receive context and execute actions.</p>

        <h2>Why is MCP Important?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beyond Static Knowledge:</strong> It allows AI to break free from the limitations of its training data, enabling access to live information (e.g., today's weather, stock prices, or your personal calendar).</li>
            <li><strong>Action and Agency:</strong> MCP provides a framework for models to not just answer questions, but to take actions on a user's behalf, such as sending an email, booking a meeting, or, in this case, deploying a web application.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Control:</strong> By standardizing the interaction, MCP puts the user in control, defining clear permissions and boundaries for what an AI can see and do.</li>
            <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> It fosters a rich ecosystem where any tool provider can make their service "MCP-compliant," instantly making it accessible to any compatible AI model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Components of an MCP Service</h2>
        <p>An MCP service essentially provides a model with structured "context." This can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-time Event Streams:</strong> Proactively pushing information to the model when something happens (e.g., a new file is saved, text is copied to the clipboard).</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge and Preference APIs:</strong> Allowing the model to securely query user-specific information (e.g., preferred coding style, project directory paths).</li>
            <li><strong>Workflow Context:</strong> Giving the model a higher-level understanding of the user's current goal (e.g., "writing a report" vs. just "editing a text file").</li>
        </ul>
